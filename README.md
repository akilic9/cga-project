Ongoing project. A 2D simple engine built on SFML. It started out as coursework but I'm expanding it becasue it's a fun project. 

TODO:
1. Complete GameObject systems.
2. Add an event system.
3. Complete the game side to be submitted for coursework.
4. Implement ECS.
5. Rework InputManager to handle multiple and different kinds of input for actions (currently only listening for keyboard input).
6. Rework map loading system to make it more user friendly.
8. Add physics.
7. Add a logger utility.
9. More comments.
